Neuralogic is a graph based binary circuit framework whose logical units are neurons based on the first McCulloch-Pitts model of the Perceptron. This project is aimed to be useful and motivational for students who start to explore the Logical and Neural Networks fields.

### Done
- LogicGates Merge
- XOR example (and others!)
- New input assignment
  - Using itertools.product
  - variables initialization
- Save weigths for then merge with fixed weigths

### To-Do
- Graphical Unit Interface
- The rest of all binary LogicGates
- Class Simplifier
  - Simplify a LogicGate to a new lg only made with NAND and NOT  
- Documentation in DocStrings
- Structural Graph
